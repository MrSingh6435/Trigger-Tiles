## ✨ What I Learned

This project taught me how to balance **technical precision** with **player experience**.  
Not just *how* a system works under the hood — but *how it feels* to the player through:
- Sound design  
- Visual cues  
- Responsive controls  
- Polished feedback systems  

It helped me understand the art of *game feel* — making every input satisfying.
