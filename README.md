# Trigger Tiles


This 2D side-scrolling shooter is all about responsive controls, immersive feedback, and snappy gameplay. I focused on making it feel smooth and satisfying â€” not just functional.

ðŸ’¡ Key Features I Implemented:

âœ… Object Pooling for optimized bullet and effect handling

âœ… Scriptable Objects for flexible game and audio configurations

âœ… Cinemachine camera shakes for impact and immersion

âœ… Custom knockback system using interfaces and animation triggers

âœ… Double Jump, Coyote Time, and Custom Gravity for tighter movement

âœ… Visual Feedback (hit flashes, screen shake, particle effects)

âœ… Dynamic Lighting + Bloom for a vibrant look

âœ… Modular Audio Manager with pitch variation and mixer support

âœ… Smooth input handling with Unityâ€™s new Input System

âœ… Clean code architecture using observer patterns, interfaces, and reusable components

âœ¨ I learned a lot during this project about what makes a game feel good â€” not just how it works behind the scenes, but how it connects with the player through sound, visuals, and responsiveness.

ðŸ“¸ Sharing some gameplay clips from the build!


ðŸŽ¯ Next Step: Continue building on these systems and applying them to future projects with more complex mechanics and storytelling.
